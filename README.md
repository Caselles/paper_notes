This contains my notes for research papers that are relevant for my PhD on Machine Learning for Robotics. First, I list papers that I've read and papers that I want to read. Then, read papers are numbered on a (1) to (5) scale where a (1) means I have only barely skimmed it, while a (5) means I feel
confident that I understand almost everything about the paper. The links
here go to my paper summaries if I have them, otherwise those papers are on my
**TODO** list.
