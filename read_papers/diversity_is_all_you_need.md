Summary:

Nice and thorough related work on learning skills. 

Key idea: maximize distinguishability, and diversity.

Formulation of the objective, use of variational lower bound to be able to compute the objective.

--------

Final thoughts:

Learn skills in an unsupervised manner, with a simple information theoretic objective. Trick: use this objective has reward for a RL algo. Neat.
