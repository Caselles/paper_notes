Summary: 

Define a more general value function that takes goals as input: $V(s,g)$, where $s$ are states, $g$ are goals. UVFA is a function approximator of the general value function. Learning a UVFA would not only generalize value to states but goals. Proposes an architecture to learn UVFAs, and demonstrate generalization across goals in simple environments.
