Summary :

This paper studies the capacity of the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework as a universal learning algorithm approximator. Since a (supervised) learning algorithm can be interpreted as a map from a dataset and an input to an output, the authors define a universal learning algorithm approximator to be a universal function approximator over the set of functions that map a set of data points and an  input to an output. The authors show constructively that there exists a neural network architecture for which the model learned through MAML can approximate any learning algorithm.
