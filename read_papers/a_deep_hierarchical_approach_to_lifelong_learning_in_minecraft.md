Summary:

Tackles lifelong learning, defines it by: . Lifelong Learning is the continued learning of tasks, from one or more domains, over the course of a lifetime, by a lifelong learning system. A lifelong learning system efficiently and effectively (1) retains the knowledge it has learned; (2) selectively transfers knowledge to learn new tasks; and (3) ensures the effective and efficient interaction between (1) and (2)(Silver, Yang, and Li 2013).

They propose an architecture for using pretrained options in a hierchical way. 

They experiment on Minecraft with sequential tasks, and show that their approach can solve these type of tasks.

Final thoughts:

I'm going to be harsh but I really don't like this paper. It is full of overstatements. There a lot of imprecisions in the paper, and what they propose does not seem that novel. Some results are nice, like the three room task is interesting and results are impressive. But the overall tone of the article made this a terrible read. Research is not marketing.
